# verge-restful-api
One of the final projects for the training program during my internship at Banno/Jack Henry &amp; Associates. I decided to put in a lot of time outside of what was required to add dependency and assure the program was running quickly/efficiently. The program uses several libraries, including Akka and Spray to create a RESTful API using an Actor System.
